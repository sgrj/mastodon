This is a fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) that has been adapted to visualize the ActivityPub protocol exchanges between different Mastodon instances. The changes are based on v4.1.2 of the main repository.

See it in action on [ActivityPub.Academy](https://activitypub.academy).
